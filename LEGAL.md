## Star Citizen / Cloud Imperium Acknowledgement

Smart Citizen is an **unofficial community tool** for Star Citizen. It is
not developed, endorsed, sponsored, or affiliated with Cloud Imperium
Games (CIG) or Roberts Space Industries (RSI) in any way.

**Star Citizen®**, **Roberts Space Industries®**, and **Cloud Imperium®**
are registered trademarks of Cloud Imperium Rights LLC and Cloud Imperium
Rights Ltd. All Star Citizen game data, including the contents of
`Data.p4k`, ship and component models, item names, mission text, and
lore, is the intellectual property of Cloud Imperium Rights LLC.

Smart Citizen does not redistribute any CIG or RSI content. The app
reads files from **your own licensed Star Citizen installation** on
your local machine and writes user-customized strings back to that same
installation. No CIG-owned content leaves your computer through Smart
Citizen.

Smart Citizen falls under CIG's "Made by the Community" guidelines for
fan-made content and tools.

## Bundled Third-Party Software

Smart Citizen ships the following third-party software inside its
installer. The full attribution text for each is in the `NOTICE` file
next to the executable.

* **unp4k / unforge** — Bundled at `assets/unp4k/` as `unp4k.exe` and
  `unforge.exe`. Osiris DevWorks ships its own fork
  ([odw-fast-unp4k](https://github.com/Osiris-DevWorks/odw-fast-unp4k))
  of the original [dolkensp/unp4k](https://github.com/dolkensp/unp4k)
  project with parallel extraction and performance improvements. Used
  to unpack `Data.p4k` and convert DataForge entity files to XML.
  Licensed under the **MIT License**.

* **PyQt6** — GUI framework, by Riverbank Computing. Used under the
  **GNU General Public License v3 (GPL-3.0)** for non-commercial
  distribution; commercial licensing is also available from Riverbank.
  Smart Citizen is a free, open-source community tool and qualifies
  under the GPL-3.0 terms.

* **lxml** — XML parsing library, by lxml.de. Used under the
  **BSD-3-Clause License**.

The Python standard library and other runtime dependencies bundled by
PyInstaller carry their own licenses; see the Python Software
Foundation License at
[https://docs.python.org/3/license.html](https://docs.python.org/3/license.html).

## Privacy & Data Handling

Smart Citizen is a **local desktop application**. It does not transmit
your edits, your `user.ini`, your `base.ini`, your customizations, or
any other content from your computer to any server operated by Osiris
DevWorks or any third party.

### What stays on your computer

Everything. Your localization edits, backups, application settings,
and DataForge cache live exclusively on your local disk:

* **Settings** — Windows Registry under
  `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Osiris DevWorks\Smart Citizen` in the
  default install, or `config.json` next to the executable in the
  portable build.
* **User edits + backups** — `Documents\Smart Citizen\{channel}\` by
  default (configurable in the Config tab; portable build uses
  `<exe-dir>\data\` instead).
* **DataForge XML cache** —
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Smart Citizen\{channel}\cache\dataforge\`.
* **Crash dumps + manual log exports** —
  `Documents\Smart Citizen\logs\` (or portable equivalent), only
  written when the app crashes or you click *Export* in the Log tab.

### What goes over the network

Smart Citizen makes outbound network requests in only two circumstances:

* **Update check** — A small unauthenticated request to
  `api.github.com/repos/Osiris-DevWorks/smart-citizen/releases/latest`
  approximately once every 6 hours to compare the installed version
  against the latest GitHub release. Returns release metadata only
  (tag name, release URL); no Smart Citizen state is sent.
* **User-configured remote sources** — If you have configured a data
  source pointing at an `http(s)://` URL in the Config tab, Smart
  Citizen fetches that URL when refreshing source files. Out of the
  box this only applies to the `global` source's GitHub-raw URL form;
  the standard configuration since v1.0 reads `base.ini` from your
  local Data.p4k extraction instead.

### What Smart Citizen does **not** do

* No telemetry, analytics, or usage reporting of any kind.
* No personally identifiable information collected, stored, or
  transmitted.
* No background data uploads.
* No automatic crash reporting to a remote server — crash dumps are
  written **locally only** under `Documents\Smart Citizen\logs\`. If
  you want to share one for a bug report, you copy and paste the file
  yourself.
* No accounts, no login, no remote identity.

If you discover behavior that conflicts with the above, please file a
bug report at
[github.com/Osiris-DevWorks/smart-citizen/issues](https://github.com/Osiris-DevWorks/smart-citizen/issues).

## AI Use Statement

Portions of Smart Citizen's source code were written with assistance
from **Claude**, Anthropic's AI coding assistant. Generated code is
**reviewed and approved by a human maintainer before merging** — the
AI does not commit directly and is treated the same as any other code
contribution: read, tested, and accepted only on its merits.

Specifically:

* AI assistance accelerates development of generators, classifiers,
  refactors, and tests; commits authored with AI help carry a
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer in their commit message so the
  history is auditable.
* All Star Citizen game-data parsing logic, mission classification,
  and string-handling rules are designed by the human maintainers and
  validated against real DataForge cache samples.
* **The application itself contains no AI or machine-learning
  features.** Smart Citizen does not bundle any model, does not call
  any AI service at runtime, and does not transmit your edits or
  Star Citizen game data to an AI provider.

## Reporting Legal Concerns

If you believe Smart Citizen infringes on a copyright, trademark, or
other right you hold — or if you have a question about how the app
handles your data — open an issue or contact the maintainers via the
