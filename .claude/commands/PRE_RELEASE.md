description: Pre-release sanity check before merging release/X.Y.Z to main — runs quality checks, a language coverage audit, a tester Test Plan refresh, security review, a contributor + tester acknowledgement audit, triggers the tester preview builds on the release PR, then closes issues testers have verified
---

# /pre_release

Run before merging the active `release/X.Y.Z` integration branch to `main`. This is the final gate before the release ships — it confirms code quality, doc currency, test coverage, that every activated language covers the release's user-facing strings and docs, that the tester Test Plan reflects this release's scope, that every code contributor is acknowledged in the project's in-app About and the README, that frequent issue reporters are recognized as testers, and that every issue fixed this cycle is closed (when tester-verified) or explicitly held.

Work through every step in order. After each step, stop at the **CHECKPOINT** and wait for the user before continuing.

## Preflight

- Confirm the current branch is `release/X.Y.Z`. If not, abort and ask the user to switch.
- Confirm working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain`). If dirty, abort.
- Confirm `VERSION.TXT` matches `X.Y.Z`. If mismatched, surface the discrepancy and ask the user before proceeding.

**CHECKPOINT — preflight confirms release branch is ready for audit. Proceed?** Wait for the user.

## 1. Test coverage check

Follow the procedure in `.claude/commands/test_coverage_check.md`. Present findings grouped by severity (Critical / Major / Minor) and end with the verdict line.

**CHECKPOINT — ready for the next check?** Wait for the user.

## 2. UI / docs / tutorial sync check

Follow the procedure in `.claude/commands/docs_sync_check.md`. Present findings grouped by severity and end with the verdict line.

**CHECKPOINT — ready for the next check?** Wait for the user.

## 3. Language support check

Follow the procedure in `.claude/commands/language_support_check.md`. Present findings grouped by severity and end with the verdict line.

This is the pre-release docs-sync moment the translation policy points at: with the user's approval at this step's checkpoint, AI backfill of missing translations is in scope here (fill `at` only, never touch a non-empty `ht`, record the work per `languages/TRANSLATIONS.md`). New strings that landed this cycle in `english/ui.json` only are exactly what this step exists to catch.

**CHECKPOINT — ready for the next check?** Wait for the user.

## 4. Test Plan currency check

The tester Test Plan (`TEST_SECTIONS` in `src/utils/test_plan.py`, surfaced by the in-app Test Plan panel, #144) must describe exactly what this release changed, because testers work through it on the preview builds and step 9's close-on-verify relies on their sign-offs.

**Sequencing note: this step is a prerequisite for the tester builds.** The plan ships inside the build, so it must land on the release branch *before* the `build-installer` / `build-portable` labels produce preview artifacts. If preview builds already went out with a stale plan, flag that: those testers are verifying the wrong checklist.

Procedure:

1. Derive the release's user-visible scope: `git log main..HEAD --oneline` (merged PRs and the issues they fix). Keep only changes a tester can observe: new features, changed flows, fixed bugs with reproducible symptoms. Internal refactors with no visible surface don't get plan items.
2. Compare that scope against the current `TEST_SECTIONS`:
   - **Missing coverage** — a user-visible change this cycle with no section/items exercising it.
   - **Stale sections** — items left over from a previous release's scope, or items describing UI that this cycle renamed or removed.
3. Report both lists. For each missing area, draft the section title and imperative, self-contained items in the module's existing style ("do X, confirm Y" — a tester needs no other doc).

Mechanics to remember: `plan_hash()` changes automatically with the content, dropping testers' stale check-marks, so no manual versioning is needed. The plan content must land via a normal PR to the release branch (branch protection blocks direct pushes).

**CHECKPOINT — present the proposed Test Plan additions/removals and ask before editing `test_plan.py`.** On approval, apply them and remind the user to re-trigger the preview builds (re-add the label or run the workflow manually) so testers get the updated plan.

## 5. Standards spot-check

Follow the procedure in `.claude/commands/standards_check.md`. Present findings grouped by severity and end with the verdict line.

**CHECKPOINT — ready for the next check?** Wait for the user.

## 6. Security review

Run `/security-review` on the pending changes. Present findings grouped by severity and end with the verdict line.

**CHECKPOINT — ready for the contributor audit?** Wait for the user.

## 7. Contributor & tester acknowledgement audit

Verify every code contributor is acknowledged in `docs/ABOUT.md` and `README.md`, and surface frequent issue reporters who should be recognized as testers.

### 7a. Build the contributor list

Pull every author who has committed code:

```bash
git log --format='%aN|%aE' --no-merges | sort -u
```

Also pull GitHub-known contributors (gives the linkable login):

```bash
gh api "repos/Osiris-DevWorks/smart-citizen/contributors" --paginate --jq '.[] | {login: .login, contributions: .contributions}'
```

**Filter out**:
- The repo owner `Osiris-DevWorks` / `Osiris DevWorks` — already credited as the maintainer.
- AI co-author trailers (`Claude`, `noreply@anthropic.com`, anything tagged `Co-Authored-By: Claude*`) — these are not collaborators.
- Bot accounts (`dependabot[bot]`, `github-actions[bot]`, `*[bot]`, etc.).
- Anonymous commits with no name or only an email and no associated GitHub login.

Normalize: when a person has committed under multiple display-name/email combinations, merge them into one entry. If unsure, surface the duplicates and let the user decide.

### 7b. Pull the current acknowledgement set

Read both:

- `docs/ABOUT.md` — the in-app About panel content. Find the **Contributors** section, the **Acknowledgements** section (the tester list lives here — look for headers containing "Acknowledg", "Credits", "Thanks"), and any **Supporters** subsection.
- `README.md` — the `## Contributors` section, the `## Acknowledgments` section (testers are listed here too), and any `### Supporters` subsection.

Build two normalized sets: **acknowledged contributors** (the Contributors list) and **acknowledged testers** (the names in the Acknowledgements/testers list). Match against the people lists using both display name and GitHub login where known.

### 7c. Categorize each missing contributor

For every contributor not currently acknowledged in **both** files (ABOUT.md and README.md):

- Pull their commit count: `git log --author='<email>' --no-merges --oneline | wc -l`
- Pull a sample of files they touched: `git log --author='<email>' --no-merges --name-only --pretty=format: | sort -u | head -10`
- Categorize:
  - **Substantial code contributor**: ≥3 commits OR touched non-trivial source files (anything under `src/`, `scripts/`, or `tests/`).
  - **Drive-by fixer**: 1–2 commits, only trivial files (README typo, comment fix, whitespace).

### 7d. Tester candidates from issue reporters

Frequent issue reporters who aren't developers are the people testing the app in the wild. Surface them so they can be acknowledged as testers (and invited to the tester group).

Count how many issues each person has reported (issues only — `gh issue list` excludes PRs by default):

```bash
gh issue list --state all --limit 1000 --json number,author --jq '.[].author.login' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

**Attribution wrinkle — read before trusting the counts.** Many issues are mirrored from Discord under a single bot author (e.g. `discohub-discord-bot` / an `app/*` login). For those, the real reporter is named in the issue body, not the `author` field (e.g. "**Narull** ([Discord](...))"). Where the author is a sync bot, read the bodies and attribute each report to the human named inside, counting by that human. Pull bodies with:

```bash
gh issue list --state all --limit 1000 --json number,author,title,body --jq '.[] | select(.author.login | test("bot|^app/")) | "\(.number)\t\(.body[0:120])"'
```

Flag every person with **3 or more** reported issues as a **candidate tester**, then filter out:
- The repo owner / maintainer (`Osiris-DevWorks`).
- Bot accounts themselves (`*[bot]`, `app/*`) — they are the transport, not a reporter.
- **Anyone who is also a code contributor** (appears in the 7a contributor list, by login or known identity). Developers are credited under **Contributors**, not Testers — never list the same person as both.
- Anyone already in the tester acknowledgement set from 7b.

If a report can't be confidently attributed to a named human, list it as unattributed rather than guessing a count.

### 7e. Report

Group missing **contributors** by significance:

```
**Missing — substantial contributors** (suggest adding):
  Jane Doe (@janedoe) — 12 commits — touched src/gui/, src/utils/
  John Smith (@johnsmith) — 8 commits — touched scripts/

**Missing — drive-by fixers** (consider adding, or skip):
  Anon Contributor — 1 commit — typo fix in README.md

**Acknowledged in ABOUT only** (also needs README): <list if any>
**Acknowledged in README only** (also needs ABOUT): <list if any>

**Already acknowledged in both** (sanity-check): N contributors covered.
```

Then list **tester candidates** (≥3 issues, not developers, not already credited):

```
**Tester candidates** (≥3 reported issues, not code contributors):
  Narull — 5 issues reported (via Discord sync)
  SomeReporter (@somereporter) — 3 issues reported

**Excluded as developers** (reported 3+ but credited under Contributors): <list if any>
```

End with a one-line **verdict** (driven by the contributor side; tester candidates are advisory and never block a release):

- **Clean** — every substantial contributor is acknowledged in both files.
- **Minor issues** — only drive-by fixers missing, or only single-file drift (acknowledged in one but not the other).
- **Needs attention** — substantial contributors missing.

Add a second line if there are tester candidates: *"Tester candidates to consider: N"* (advisory only).

**CHECKPOINT — pause and ask the user whether to draft additions to `docs/ABOUT.md` and `README.md`** (mirrored in both so they stay in sync): contributor names into the **Contributors** section, and any approved tester candidates into the **Acknowledgements** tester list. Do not edit either file without confirmation.

## 8. Final Test Plan refresh, then trigger the tester preview builds

The plan ships inside the build, so this step does two things in order: bring the Test Plan checklist up to date one last time, then label the release PR — the `build-installer` and `build-portable` labels are what make `installer-preview.yml` and `portable-preview.yml` produce the downloadable artifacts testers verify against.

Procedure:

1. Find the release PR: `gh pr list --base main --head release/X.Y.Z --state open --json number,title`.
2. If none exists, this is the moment to open it — `main` only ever receives the release-branch merge via PR, so it's needed for the ship step anyway. Title `Release X.Y.Z`, body summarizing the release scope (link the release notes if drafted). **Opening the PR is not merging it** — the merge stays the user's ship trigger.
3. **Refresh the Test Plan checklist — always the step right before labeling.** Step 4 ran earlier, but steps 3–7 can land more commits on the branch (language backfills, acknowledgement edits, close-out fixes). Re-run step 4's delta pass — `git log main..HEAD --oneline` vs the current `TEST_SECTIONS` in `src/utils/test_plan.py` — and draft items for anything user-visible that landed since. If there are updates, present them, and on approval land them via a normal PR to the release branch (branch protection blocks direct pushes), so the plan is final before any artifact builds. If nothing changed since step 4, say so and move on.
4. Add both labels: `gh pr edit <N> --add-label build-installer --add-label build-portable`.
5. Report the two workflow runs once they start (`gh run list --limit 2`) so the user can watch them, and note the artifact names (`smartcitizen-installer-{SHA}`, `smartcitizen-portable-{SHA}`, 30-day retention).

Mechanics to remember: later pushes to the labeled PR rebuild automatically (`synchronize`), so a post-audit fix landing on the release branch refreshes the artifacts without re-labeling. If the labels were already present from an earlier round, re-add them (remove + add) or dispatch the workflows manually so a build runs with the current head.

**CHECKPOINT — confirm before opening the release PR (if needed) and adding the labels; both actions are visible on GitHub and start CI builds.** Wait for the user.

## 9. Issue close-on-verify pass

Every issue fixed this cycle should be resolved in the tracker before the merge. An open "fixed" issue at merge time means either a missed close or an unverified fix riding into the release. Close the ones a tester has confirmed; explicitly hold the ones still awaiting a test pass.

**This step runs last because it depends on step 8.** Verification comes from testers working through the Test Plan on the preview builds, which don't exist until the labels go on. On the day the audit runs, most issues will legitimately sit in "awaiting verification" — that is the expected outcome, not a failure. Report the buckets, close whatever is already confirmed, and expect to re-run this step (`/pre_release` step 9 alone is fine) once tester sign-offs come back, before the merge to `main`.

### 9a. Gather the release's issues

Two sources, unioned:

- Issues tagged for this release: `gh issue list --state open --label next-release --json number,title,author`
- Issues referenced by commits merged since the last release: `git log main..HEAD --oneline` and pull every `#NN` from the messages (these are the fixes that actually landed on the branch).

### 9b. Classify each

For each issue, find out whether a tester has confirmed the fix. Look for a confirming comment from the reporter or a tester on a preview build, a Discord-synced follow-up, or a clear "works now" reaction. Pull the conversation when unsure:

```bash
gh issue view <N> --json title,state,comments --jq '.title, (.comments[]?|"\(.user.login): \(.body[0:200])")'
```

Then bucket:

- **Fixed + tester-verified** → close candidate.
- **Fixed, awaiting verification** → hold (these carry the "potential fix, please test" comment but no confirmation yet). Do not close on the developer's say-so alone — a passing local test is not a tester sign-off.
- **Not addressed** → flag. It should not carry `next-release` into the merge if it isn't shipping this cycle; surface it for the user to re-label or defer.

### 9c. Report

```
**Verified — close candidates:**
  #187 Unknown spawn line — confirmed by Narull on the a04fb98 build

**Awaiting verification — hold open:**
  #186 satellite hostiles — fix pushed, tester not yet confirmed

**Not addressed — re-label or defer:**
  #190 Balandin quantum drive — no fix on the branch
```

**CHECKPOINT — present the close / hold / flag list and ask before closing anything.** On confirmation, close each verified issue with a short comment in the project voice (plain thanks, the version the fix shipped in, a reopen path) and credit the tester who confirmed it. Do not close an issue without the user's go-ahead, and never close one that is only awaiting verification.

## Final summary

After all nine steps complete, give a one-line overall verdict for release readiness — the worst-case verdict across the checks. List any remaining Critical/Major findings the user needs to address before the `release/X.Y.Z` → `main` merge, plus any issues still open that were expected to ship this cycle.

Say plainly where the release stands on testing: the builds are out, and anything step 9 left in "awaiting verification" is now waiting on testers, not on the audit. Re-run step 9 when their sign-offs land.

Reminder: this command does not ship the release. Merging `release/X.Y.Z` to `main`, tagging, building the installer, and creating the GitHub release are separate steps documented in root `CLAUDE.md` → *Version & Release → Release checklist*.
