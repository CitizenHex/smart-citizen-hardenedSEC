"""The tester test-plan: content, progress math, and report formatting (#144).

Smart Citizen ships a "Test Plan" panel so testers on a pre-release build can
work through what changed in the release and check items off as they verify
them. This module is the Qt-free core: the plan content itself, the
progress/key helpers, and the markdown report a tester submits. The Qt panel
(`src/gui/test_plan_panel.py`) and the Discord-submit worker
(`TestPlanSubmitWorker` in `src/gui/workers.py`) build on these.

The content tracks the diff that the active release branch carries over its
integration base, so each release's plan covers exactly what's new. Update
TEST_SECTIONS when a release's scope changes; `plan_hash()` changes with it, so
a tester's stale check-marks are dropped rather than silently mislabelled.
